## About me

<img src="https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/591035822534666-1517925329445_Q512/Rui_Borges4.jpg" height="250">

I am a lecturer in Statistics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Statistical Medicine and Molecular Biology group. I am fascinated by the evolution of genomic sequences, and my work involves developing theoretical models of sequence evolution that aim to reconcile the population- and species-level processes through which species continuously emerge and diverge. My research also includes developing computational and statistical methods to detect molecular signatures of evolutionary significance from large-scale genomic datasets, which are now commonplace in molecular studies.

Interests:
* Population genetics
* Phylogenetics
* Bayesian inference
* Bioinformatics
