## PhD position in computational evolutionary biology 

**Title**: Unraveling the impact of gene flow during species divergence

We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student with skills in computational biology and/or biostatistics to embark on this cutting-edge research project. The goal is to develop more realistic models and computationally efficient methods that will enable the analysis of extensive phylogenomic datasets, which are now commonplace in evolutionary biology. The methods will be implemented into the widely-used software RevBayes.

Understanding how species diverge through the exchange of genetic material is a fascinating area of study. While evidence of gene flow exists across diverse biological groups, there is a critical need to assess its prevalence and impact at phylogenetic time scales. Current models fall short, particularly when evaluating gene flow along multiple speciation events, especially at deep time horizons. 

This project will develop more complex phylogenetic models and draw insights from diverse organisms, including grasshoppers, fruit flies, persimmon trees, and fireflies. We aim to answer these three key questions:

* What is the evolutionary significance of gene flow during species divergence?
* Are most regions of the genome affected by gene flow, or do some regions show an elevated impact of gene flow?
* What is the interplay between natural selection and gene flow during species evolution?

The successful candidate will be stationed at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and affiliated with the Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics. For more information, visit the school's [webpage](https://www.popgen-vienna.at/). There is also a potential opportunity for a 6-month to one-year assignment abroad. 

**Requirements**: The main requirement of this position is that the candidate is proficient in at least one coding language. A second skill would be either (1) understanding of evolution and handling of genomic data or (2) statistical inference. 

**Salary**: 14 times a year, according to this [table](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/funding/steps-to-your-fwf-project/further-information/personnel-costs).

**How to Apply**: Interested candidates are invited to submit their applications, including a brief CV and a one-page cover letter outlining their research experience and interest in the project, to ruiborges23@gmail.com. The application deadline is May 30th; however, applications will be evaluated on a rolling basis until a suitable candidate is selected.
